          <span>Verified Graduate</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="disc">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</div>
      <div class="disc-1"> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</div>

      <div class="disc">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</div>
      <div class="disc-1">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="disc">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div>
      <div class="disc-1">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù</div>

      </div>
      <div class="disc">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</div>
      <div class="disc-1">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</div>
